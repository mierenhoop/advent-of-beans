# Advent of beans

Advent of code clone built with [Redbean](https://redbean.dev/).

## Status

*I do not plan to create actual puzzles and host an event. If you are interested in using this project for hosting an event and need help, create a Github issue or contact me.*

As of the time of writing it has the following features:
* Page listing all the puzzles
* Puzzles have a starting time
* Puzzle inputs and answers are stored in buckets, some users will share a bucket
* Wrong answer submit timeout
* Leaderboard for everything & individual puzzles
* Statistics
* Silver and gold stars
* User profile page
* Github integration
* Cached remote resources to support private networks
* All-in-one binary with control of the database via the command line
* No javascript

Todo list:
* Rate limiting/DDOS protection
* Support multiple events
* Better styling
* Stress testing
* Generally refactor aiming for simplicity
