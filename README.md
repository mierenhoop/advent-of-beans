# Advent of beans

Advent of code clone built with [Redbean](https://redbean.dev/).

## Status

*I will pause development on this project because it is currently in a working state. I did not plan to create actual puzzles and host an event, therefore adding new features might be a waste of time. If anyone is interested in using this project for hosting their event, create a github issue or contact me so I can help you get it set up.*

As of the time of writing it has the following features:
* Page listing all the puzzles
* Puzzle can have starting time
* Puzzle inputs are stored in buckets, some users will share a bucket
* Wrong answer submit timeout
* Leaderboard for everything & individual puzzles
* Silver and gold stars
* User profile page
* Github integration
* Cached remote resources to enable use in private networks
* All-in-one binary with control of the database via the command line
* No javascript

Todo list:
* Rate limiting/DDOS protection
* Support multiple events
